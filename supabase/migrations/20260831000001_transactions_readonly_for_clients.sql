-- Migration: 20260831000001_transactions_readonly_for_clients.sql
-- Issue: #31 — any authenticated user can forge transaction history.
--
-- The transactions table is the payments ledger. Historically the RLS policy
-- "transactions_insert_participant" let any authenticated user INSERT a row as
-- long as their own wallet appeared as sender or recipient, so a user could
-- claim they received any amount, from anyone, with status 'success' and an
-- arbitrary tx_hash. refresh_merchant_totals() sums this same table, so
-- merchant revenue was a number the merchant's own customers could write.
--
-- This migration is idempotent and additive: it re-asserts the lockdown from
-- 20260829000001 for environments that were provisioned from the older
-- App/supabase_schema.sql, and restores merchant-scoped SELECT access that the
-- earlier lockdown dropped. Existing rows are never touched.
